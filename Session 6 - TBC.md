# Oceanus & the Hold
- The sea elves have been tracking the sea princes through there territory, and [[Oceanus]] has been tasked with finding out where they're there, but he was captured
	- We don't think he's lying about this
## First Mate's Cabin
- Much, much tidier and cleaner than the bosun's cabin
- We find another hidden cell! This one is being used as a storage room
- There's a cache of weapons in here!
	- A variety of weapons and armour
	- One more elegant-looking shield, with Lizardman iconography on it (non-magical)
- The rest of the lower deck just has supplies for a long journey and the crew's quarters
## The Hold
- The hatch to the hold has some mysterious arcane scrawlings on it. It looks almost conversational. Candles have been burned here. Some sort of ritual?
- The hold is *dark*. We lower a lantern inside but the light seems to fall off unnaturally fast...
- As [[Agevea]]'s hand touches the darkness, she goes limp and falls into the darkness. The lantern light disappears!
- The hold is a flat-bottomed space with manacles lining the walls. It appears to be empty.
- As [[Tiresias]] enters, the combined sorrow of all of the beings that have been enslaved in here washes over and into him all at once. He arrives at the bottom to find Agavea conscious but unresponsive, curled up on her side, eyes wide. The others hoist her out on a rope.
- Seems like the mage was trying to seal in whatever spirit was here.
## Heading home
- We take the cache of weapons and leave the ship
- Tiresias names the pseudodragon on the way home
- We arrive at Acheron's house and take a long rest
## Seeing Elander
- We want to work on the suspicion [[Elander Fireborn]] already has for the council, by hinting that we know [[Gellin Primewater]] is involved with the [[Sea Princes]]. We can't reveal that overtly as it would out [[Agevea]] as an ex-seaprince
- We convince Elander that the Sea Princes were waiting for someone important. He seems very interested in the weapons and says if we let him have them we'll earn his trust. He seemed to recognise something in them
- He pays us 400gp total for the mission, and is going to burn the ship
- We're summoned to the council chambers the following morning
## Gellin's Party
- At [[Gellin Primewater's House]]
- The whole thing is carnage - half the town is here, people of every generation. Feels like a big town get-together, everyone is mixing happily.
- [[Kolinth]] finds the mushrooms he gave to the chef have been prepared into a canape
- We hatch a plan where Kolinth will resummon his familiar as a spider and we'll do some snooping
- [[Tiresias]] telepathically goes *"I have a message from your friends off-shore. They're growing suspicious. Be careful."*
	- He seems panicked, and believes the message
-
