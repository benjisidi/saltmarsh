# Oceanus & the Hold
- The sea elves have been tracking the sea princes through there territory, and [[Oceanus]] has been tasked with finding out where they're there, but he was captured
	- We don't think he's lying about this
## First Mate's Cabin
- Much, much tidier and cleaner than the bosun's cabin
- We find another hidden cell! This one is being used as a storage room
- There's a cache of weapons in here!
	- A variety of weapons and armour
	- One more elegant-looking shield, with Lizardman iconography on it (non-magical)
- The rest of the lower deck just has supplies for a long journey and the crew's quarters
## The Hold
- The hatch to the hold has some mysterious arcane scrawlings on it. It looks almost conversational. Candles have been burned here. Some sort of ritual?
- The hold is *dark*. We lower a lantern inside but the light seems to fall off unnaturally fast...
- As [[Agevea]]'s hand touches the darkness, she goes limp and falls into the darkness. The lantern light disappears!
- The hold is a flat-bottomed space with manacles lining the walls. It appears to be empty.
- As [[Tiresias]] enters, the combined sorrow of all of the beings that have been enslaved in here washes over and into him all at once. He arrives at the bottom to find Agavea conscious but unresponsive, curled up on her side, eyes wide. The others hoist her out on a rope.
- Seems like the mage was trying to seal in whatever spirit was here.
## Heading home
- We take the cache of weapons and leave the ship
- Tiresias names the pseudodragon on the way home
- We arrive at Acheron's house and take a long rest
