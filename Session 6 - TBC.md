# Oceanus & the Hold
- The sea elves have been tracking the sea princes through there territory, and [[Oceanus]] has been tasked with finding out where they're there, but he was captured
	- We don't think he's lying about this
## First Mate's Cabin
- Much, much tidier and cleaner than the bosun's cabin
- We find another hidden cell! This one is being used as a storage room
- There's a cache of weapons in here!
- The rest of the lower deck just has supplies for a long journey and the crew's quarters
## The Hold
- The hatch to the hold has some mysterious arcane scrawlings on it. It looks almost conversational. Candles have been burned here. Some sort of ritual?
- The hold is *dark*. We lower a lantern inside but the light seems to fall off unnaturally fast...
- As [[Agevea]]'s hand touches the darkness, she goes limp and falls into the darkness
