# Chasing down Sambalet
[[The Wizard Sambalet]] makes it through the secret door back up to the basement before the rest of us and locks it behind us. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet. [[Tiresias]] snaps his knife while trying to jimmy the door with it.

He escapes by the time we destroy the door, and we decide to have a break and explore the caverns more thoroughly. We find:
- 10 bolts of silk (v. valuable)
- 16 casks of brandy
*We're gonna need a bigger boat to get these out of here*

The bandits seem to mostly be Sea Princes. The hobgoblin has some sort of magical armour scale mail covered in sea-themed inscriptions.

We long rest in the basement and discuss what to do. [[Agevea]] seems to know a lot about the [[Sea Princes]]... If we want to ambush them, we'll need to go out on the little boat we found to *their* ship.
# Investigating the Manor
## Lower Floor
We find a variety of fun bits looking through the lower floor:
- Delicious red mushrooms
- 2 cut pieces of blue quartz (10gp each)
- We notice the ceiling in room 6 is bulging, the floor above must be weak!
2. A library! Three interesting books (5-10gp each?):
	- The magical properties of gemstones by the archmage Tensor
	- The magical properties of herbs and flowers by the archmage Tensor
	- The metaphysics of mathematics by the mage Nystul
		- There are some notes saying "beyond skeletons"
3. A study. A large ornate desk with a view out to sea.
- Everything is coated in a thick layer of dust, save a set of footprints leading up to the 2nd floor...
## Upper Floor:
13. Bedroom: Moldering cloth, discarded small items, *a glint in the fireplace*...and SPIDERS!
> *We kill the spiders*. *The footsteps split between 14 and 15*
14. Another decaying bedroom. The footsteps avoid the bowing, rotting floor and head to an open window. This is where the Sea Princes signal incoming ships!
15. *Another* decaying bedroom. Footprints look more recent - last couple of days. There's a set of manacles and marks in the dust where someone has lain on the floor, seemingly tied up.
> *The other side of the hall...*
   11 . A much grander bedroom - two poster bed. We find a once-grand, now moldy cloak.
   12 . An adjoining room for the grand bedroom. Once a storage room, now mostly empty. We find a matching set of gloves for the cloak.

Looking through the [[Sea Princes]] logbook, we can see they've been here for a few years. They receive deliveries roughly once a month, and their last one was a few days ago, so we probably have nearly a month to prepare!
16. An old, decrepit study. Nothing of interest.
17. A storage room. Nothing of interest.
## Attic
We are immediately attacked by six [Sturges](), but overcome them easily. The attic is mostly full of bric-a-brac, but we find an ornate porcelain sailor doll.
## Downtime...
We have about 1 mo. til the [[Sea Princes]] arrive! In the meantime...
- [[Kolinth]] gives the mushrooms we found in [[Bracksmore]] to the cook for the feast.
- [[Tiresias]] spends a while examining the [[Sea Princes Logbook]], figures out what the routine is, and learns the signal code.
- The gang forge a letter telling [[Keledek the Unspoken]]
- We go to a pawn shop on the outskirts of town [[Winston's Store]], and sell some of our loot.
- [[Agevea]] begins to notice some bestial moments from time to time - she destroys a stein
## Discussions with [[Elander Fireborn]]
We head to the [[Guard Tower]] to talk to Elander to ask what to do about the [[Sea Princes]].
