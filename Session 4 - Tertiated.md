# Chasing down Sambalet
[[The Wizard Sambalet]] makes it through the secret door back up to the basement before the rest of us and locks it behind us. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet. [[Tiresias]] snaps his knife while trying to jimmy the door with it.

He escapes by the time we destroy the door, and we decide to have a break and explore the caverns more thoroughly. We find:
- 10 bolts of silk (v. valuable)
- 16 casks of brandy
*We're gonna need a bigger boat to get these out of here*

The bandits seem to mostly be Sea Princes. The hobgoblin has some sort of magical armour scale mail covered in sea-themed inscriptions.

We long rest in the basement and discuss what to do. [[Agevea]] seems to know a lot about the [[Sea Princes]]... If we want to ambush them, we'll need to go out on the little boat we found to *their* ship.
# Investigating the Manor
## Lower Floor
We find a variety of fun bits looking through the lower floor:
- Delicious red mushrooms
- 2 cut pieces of blue quartz (10gp each)
- We notice the ceiling in room 6 is bulging, the floor above must be weak!
2. A library! Three interesting books (5-10gp each?):
	- The magical properties of gemstones by the archmage Tensor
	- The magical properties of herbs and flowers by the archmage Tensor
	- The metaphysics of mathematics by the mage Nystul
		- There are some notes saying "beyond skeletons"
3. A study. A large ornate desk with a view out to sea.
- Everything is coated in a thick layer of dust, save a set of footprints leading up to the 2nd floor...
## Upper Floor:
13. Bedroom: Moldering cloth, discarded small items, *a glint in the fireplace*...and SPIDERS!
> *We kill the spiders*. *The footsteps split between 14 and 15*
14. Another decaying bedroom. The footsteps avoid the bowing, rotting floor and head to an open window. This is where the Sea Princes signal incoming ships!
15. *Another* decaying bedroom. Footprints look more recent - last couple of days. There's a set of manacles and marks in the dust where someone has lain on the floor, seemingly tied up.
> *The other side of the hall...*
   11 . A much grander bedroom - two poster bed. We find a once-grand, now moldy cloak.
   12 . An adjoining room for the grand bedroom. Once a storage room, now mostly empty. We find a matching set of gloves for the cloak.

Looking through the [[Sea Princes]] logbook, we can see they've been here for a few years. They receive deliveries roughly once a month, and their last one was a few days ago, so we probably have nearly a month to prepare!
16. An old, decrepit study. Nothing of interest.
17. A storage room. Nothing of interest.
## Attic
We are immediately attacked by six [Sturges](), but overcome them easily. The attic is mostly full of bric-a-brac, but we find an ornate porcelain sailor doll.
## Downtime...
We have about 1 mo. til the [[Sea Princes]] arrive! In the meantime...
- [[Kolinth]] gives the mushrooms we found in [[Bracksmore]] to [[Betsy]] the cook for the feast.
- [[Tiresias]] spends a while examining the [[Sea Princes Logbook]], figures out what the routine is, and learns the signal code.
- The gang forge a letter telling [[Keledek the Unspoken]], saying that Tiresias has been called away and won't be seconded to him any more. Then they steal a couple of spells from his
- We go to a pawn shop on the outskirts of town [[Winston's Store]], and sell some of our loot.
- [[Agevea]] begins to notice some bestial moments from time to time - she destroys a stein by accident.
## Discussions with [[Elander Fireborn]]
We head to the [[Guard Tower]] to talk to Elander to ask what to do about the [[Sea Princes]]. He says he'll convene the town council and they'll decide on the exact next course of action.
He also catches us lying about the silk and brandy we found, and says the town will requisition it and give us a cut.
## The Council Meeting
Listening to the previous petitioners, it's a mixture of dull things ("farmer blah planted a shrubbery on our land" and people worried about the lizardfolk).
[[Saltmarsh Council]] sits waiting for us:
- [[Eda Owland]]: Businesslike, this is one of many meeting
- [[Gellin Primewater]]: Outwardly calm, inwardly a bit panicky, "I need to get this out of here"
- [[Elander Fireborn]]: Sus of the rest of the council, can't tell who in particular
- [[Anders Solomon]]: The Sea Princes are personal for him. His butler has an oddly still mind.
- [[A Dwarf]]: Very bored - "what the fuck am I doing here"

There are some pleasantries, then we get down to brass tax. Sea Princes don't usually operate this close to Saltmarsh, so if we destroy this ship we reckon they'll leave. If we destroy the ship, they'll probably not come back. We'll get paid 450gp, of which we've already been paid 150.
## Planning the Attack
- Agavea shows us a sea prince brand which has been tattoo'd over
- Our plan is:
	- She goes and talks to the Sea Princes when they arrive
	- We tell some of them to come and pick up the silk
	- We fight those people in the cave
	- Then we fight the other people out on the ship
	- We've got a couple of poachers (father son pair called the Brians) who have come to help us
## The Ambush
- We send over the right codes, Agavea rows out to the boats and convinces 5 of the Sea Princes to come ashore. They're all rowing back towards the cave.
- Agavea is going to lead them into the big round cave (27) where the Brians are waiting with longbows.
- Tiresias and Kolinth are waiting in the corridor of 26 to join the fight
