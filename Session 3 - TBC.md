# [[Bracksmore]] Cellar
We open the danger door (*obviously*) and there's skeletons inside (oh no!). They're being held together with brass wire and pins, clearly been constructed.
While we're fighting them, the back wall is lit by blue flames a mysterious figure emerges from a hidden door! They're also a skeleton, but have ghostly spirit-like skin and hair overlaid over the top. They throw acid pellets at us, we reckon they're the old alchemist!

We destroy the skeletons and the alchemist. ([[Agevea]] cuts his head in half at the mouth). As he dies, the spirit disappears and the bones turn to dust.

At the end of the session, recap what's happened for easy re-reading
