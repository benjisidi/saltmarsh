# [[Bracksmore]] Cellar
We open the danger door (*obviously*) and there's skeletons inside (oh no!). They're being held together with brass wire and pins, clearly been constructed.
While we're fighting them, the back wall is lit by blue flames a mysterious figure emerges from a hidden door! They're also a skeleton, but have ghostly skin and hair overlaid over the top. They throw acid pellets at us, we reckon they're the old alchemist!
