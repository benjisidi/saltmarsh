# [[Bracksmore]] Cellar
We open the danger door (*obviously*) and there's skeletons inside (oh no!). They're being held together with brass wire and pins, clearly been constructed.
While we're fighting them, the back wall is lit by blue flames a mysterious figure emerges from a hidden door! They're also a skeleton, but have ghostly spirit-like skin and hair overlaid over the top. They throw acid pellets at us, we reckon they're the old alchemist!

We destroy the skeletons and the alchemist. ([[Agevea]] cuts his head in half at the mouth). As he dies, the spirit disappears and the bones turn to dust.

Each skeleton had a golden rib bone with runes on it. The runes on them contain the necromantic spell that was binding their souls here from the spirit

The alchemist was wearing a bag of holding and carrying a small pebble engraved with tiny golden lines. We're not sure what it is for.

In the hidden room is the
- A book called [[Ye Secret of Ye Philosopher's Stone]]
- Scattered golden objects (all seem ornamental - they have tiny tool marks on them, seem to have been made by hand)
	- A human skull
	- An apple
	- A rose
	- 5 small disks
- A spell book containing:
	- Dancing lights
	- Comprehend languages
	- Tenser's floating disk
	- Shatter
# The Stairs Down
We head back to the main room and check for any more hidden doors. We find one in a corner and it reveals a staircase heading downwards, even deeper into the cliff beneath the manor.

The staircase leads to a natural cave in the cliff. There's well trodden paths here and a scattering of naval detritus, but the tracks avoid two conspicuous areas that have been avoided. [[Acheron]] recognises the green slime on the roof as carnivorous and we avoid it.

[[Aurora]] gets pelted with arrows and has to fly back to the party! We discuss a plan but they're waiting for us when we leave the staircase and a fight breaks out. We catch sight of some more [[Sea Princes]] and a heavily armoured hobgoblin. They're being led by a tall thin man wearing a floppy pointed hat - his voice seems to match the *WELCOME TO HELL* we heard in [[Session 1]]. He's [[The Wizard Sambalet]].

Acheron is killed by [[The Wizard Sambalet]] during the following melee. [[Agevea]] escapes by diving off the cliff and [[Kolinth]] charms the guard to get rid of his body and runs away.
# Back in Saltmarsh
[[Kolinth]] writes an epic tale about [[Acheron]] and [[Agevea]]'s life and death, and Agevea arrives in the pub while he's telling the story. Agevea teaches Kolinth the value of patie
