# [[Bracksmore]] Cellar
We open the danger door (*obviously*) and there's skeletons inside (oh no!). They're being held together with brass wire and pins, clearly been constructed.
While we're fighting them, the back wall is lit by blue flames a mysterious figure emerges from a hidden door! They're also a skeleton, but have ghostly spirit-like skin and hair overlaid over the top. They throw acid pellets at us, we reckon they're the old alchemist!

We destroy the skeletons and the alchemist. ([[Agevea]] cuts his head in half at the mouth). As he dies, the spirit disappears and the bones turn to dust.

Each skeleton had a golden rib bone with runes on it. The runes on them contain the necromantic spell that was binding their souls here from the spirit

The alchemist was wearing a bag of holding and carrying a small pebble engraved with tiny golden lines. We're not sure what it is for.

In the hidden room is the
- A book called [[Ye Secret of Ye Philosopher's Stone]]
- Scattered golden objects (all seem ornamental - they have tiny tool marks on them, seem to have been made by hand)
	- A human skull
	- An apple
	- A rose
	- 5 small disks
- A spell book containing:
	- Dancing lights
	- Comprehend languages
	- Tenser's floating disk
	- Shatter
