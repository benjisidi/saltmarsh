# Chasing down Sambalet
[[The Wizard Sambalet]] makes it through the secret door back up to the basement before the rest of us and locks it behind us. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet. [[Tiresias]] snaps his knife while trying to jimmy the door with it.

He escapes by the time we destroy the door, and we decide to have a break and explore the caverns more thoroughly. We find:
- 10 bolts of silk (v. valuable)
- 16 casks of brandy
*We're gonna need a bigger boat to get these out of here*

The bandits seem to mostly be Sea Princes. The hobgoblin has some sort of magical armour scale mail covered in sea-themed inscriptions.

We long rest in the basement and discuss what to do. [[Agevea]] seems to know a lot about the [[Sea Princes]]... If we want to ambush them, we'll need to go out on the little boat we found to *their* ship.
# Investigating the Manor
## Lower Floor
We find a variety of fun bits looking through the lower floor:
- Delicious red mushrooms
- 2 cut pieces of blue quartz (10gp each)
- We notice the ceiling in room 6 is bulging, the floor above must be weak!
- Everything is coated in a thick layer of dust, save a set of footprints leading up to the 2nd floor...
## Upper Floor:
13. Bedroom: Moldering cloth, discarded small items, *a glint in the fireplace*...and SPIDERS!
> *We kill the spiders*. *The footsteps split between 14 and 15*
14. Another decaying bedroom. The footsteps avoid the bowing, rotting floor and head to an open window. This is where the Sea Princes signal incoming ships!
15. *Another* decaying bedroom. Footprints look more recent - last couple of days. There's a set of manacles and marks in the dust where someone has lain on the floor, seemingly tied up.
