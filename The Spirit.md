- Fey-meets-the-warp
- Infinitely big, lots of different regions
- People in the material world affect the warp and vice versa
	- Large collections of people, geographical features etc leave imprints on in, along with particularly strong emotions and beliefs etc
- Space is warped weirdly in the spirit - it has analogs to places in the material, but the space between them etc doesn't need to make sense: the spirit is infinite, and the material is not
	- Wherever you are in the spirit, the [[River Danue]] is running through it somewhere
- When most people die, their energy sort of dissipates into the spirit
	- That's not true for everyone: for some people, they linger more cohesively
		- This is true of traditional ghosts with unfinished business, and also of great figures or folk heroes who left an imprint on the world

# How the spirit facilitates spellcasting
## Illusion/Transmutation
Warping something's representation in the spirit to a lesser or greater extent can either provide the illusion of change in the material or actually physically manifest it

## Enchantment/Psyonics
By projecting your mind into the spirit, you can find the minds of others and tinker with their perceptions of reality, or convey information to and from them

# Magical Logic:
There is the real and the spirit. The real is the material, mundane world of beings born of the earth. The spirit at its core, is the collected experience of beings in the real.

Every living thing has a connection to the spirit, a reservoir of emotion and experience within it, a soul. A tiny pocket of purest spirit.

Every experience of a soul feeds back into the spirit as it happens. The brighter the soul and the more powerful the emotion the stronger the feedback. These wisps of experience float through the spirit, like attracting like, until they form powerful reflections of the real: huge forests of dark trees born of the endless fear of the small creatures of innocent forests in the real, giant rivers of fire and pain created by human experiences with fire or wondrous places of natural beauty that transcend the original in the real.

But living souls are not the only interaction between real and spirit. The spirit doesn’t have a geography, it lies over the real like fog over a city, constantly moving and shifting. At places of great resonance the boundary becomes frayed and it’s possible to stray from one world into the other. 

Creatures are born in the spirit. When enough human emotion gathers it can gain sentience. There are creatures formed of pure malice or wonder or joy. Whole races of spirits have risen and fallen as their connection to the real has waxed and waned. There are echoes of trees and rivers that resonated with so many souls over so much time that they have their own personality and shape. In turn, these sentient echoes can influence the places or people in the real they are most tethered to.

There are no gods, an idea that human could not survive in the spirit. But there are powerful entities that have a consciousness of sorts and take interest in events and individuals in the real. Anything with enough power to reach the real has to be a totemic concept, to have gathered enough energy to effect the real. These tend to be natural phenomena that have a location or physical representation to latch onto if they don't, the human idea of them changes so quickly that they don’t cohere over time and fail to gain the solidity they need.

The spirit can and does hold power in the real, and this power is wielded by individuals that can tap into it. Through study and intellect some can bind elements of the spirit to the real and draw power through them. Some souls are born shining so bright, or are so connected to some powerful aspect of the spirit that they can summon otherworldly power at will.

When a creature with a soul dies, its undiluted collection of memories and emotions hits the spirit like a drop of ink into a river. Souls of titanic strength and definition can survive this contact, these mighty souls will stride the spirit as ancestor spirits and legends made manifest.
