# Our Protagonists Assemble
We begin our adventure with [[Acheron]] talking to [[Kolinth]] on his barge. Acheron has been regaling Kolinth with stories of his past, and talk turns to the recent reports of sounds and lights coming from [[Bracksmore]], a long-abandoned house in town.

There's a handsome reward (posted by [[Elander Fireborn]]), for anyone who can conclusively determine what's been going on, so the two decide to pursue it together.

They reckon they're going to need some help (as it's probably dangerous) and Acheron suggests recruiting the services of [[Agevea]]. They head to [[The Wicker Goat]], where she's known to drink. Acheron offers her considerably less than her share of the bounty (75GP) and she accepts. The three head to the [[Guard Tower]] to get more information from Elander.
# Meeting Elander
Elander tells the party Bracksmore was quiet for a long time, and in the last year people have seen strange lights and heard ghastly shrieks. There's rumours some people have tried to investigate it and have been scared away by paranormal experiences.

One of those people was a poacher somewhere in town, but Elander hasn't been able to locate him - just knows he wears a green cloak and goes by something like *[[Peter]]*. He also mentions the bounty amount and Agevea re-negotiates her fee...
# Finding Peter
The gang head to a local [[Speakeasy]] and meet [[Curtly]]. After a short chat and a drink, Curtly tells us we can find Peter at [[The Snapping Line]], and we head there to find him. Kolinth does a good job of getting him to talk, and he gives us the following information:
* He went to Bracksmore and tracked something in the garden
* The front door was open, and he decided to have a look around
* Went up the stairs and saw ghastly sound and huge eyes, eventually an apparition with huge scary claws
* As he was leaving, a great green light shot up from the house
