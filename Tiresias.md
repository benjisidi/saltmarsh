- In Saltmarsh to contact [[Keledek the Unspoken]].
# Eladrin Grove
- Telepathy is known and accepted here
- Tiresias knew [[Kolinth]] as children here
- Tiresias was curious about the outside world as the grove is quite cloistered
	- The grove is sort of timeless - things pass by in the wider world without the elves really taking much notice
	- As a result there's also a dearth of news and knowledge about the world and happenings in it
- He also had ambitions to expand his magical skill, and that would have been difficult to achieve while staying home
- Tiresias has a misplaced amount of confidence due to his magical abilities
- Stowed away on a trade caravan after talking big about leaving for a long time
## ToDo (with Cian):
- [ ] There's some timey-wimey stuff happening in the grove
- [ ] I think Tiresias and Kolinth were friends as kids, bonded by their mutual curiosity about the wider world.
# Capital City
- There's low-level prejudice towards non-humans in Keoland, something the elves are largely sheltered from and ignorant of
	- There's a hierarchy - the more human-y you are, the less mistreated (i.e. elves and dwarves are treated better than lisardmen)
