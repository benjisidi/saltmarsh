# Description
Big, gruff, human woman. Lots of fisherman's tattoos (all the boats she's been on), short silver hair, lots of earrings, fairly nice clothing. Head of the [[Saltmarsh Council]]. Stubborn, but quick to help those in need. Very much Saltmarsh-first in her outlook.
# Location
Sometimes found in the [[The Snapping Line]]
# Additional Notes
A lot of her tattoos correspond to ships that can be found in the Saltmarsh docks. You get them for serving with distinction on a fishing vessel.
