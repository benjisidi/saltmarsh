RELEASE THE GELLIN FILES
# Gellin's Party
- [[Tiresias]] goes to ask [[Agevea]] if she's heard of [[Harvey Cutt]] or where he might be found, but she hasn't heard of him and doesn't know where Saltmarsh's illicit activity tends to take place
- [[Kolinth]] tells an absolute bomb of a story about rabbits and impresses exactly one man named Courtney
- We follow catch Harvey's trail and manage to follow him into town
- Seems like he's heading to the [[Speakeasy]] run by [[Curtly]]
  - We follow him there, and he heads upstairs to have a conversation with someone unknown - we don't manage to divine much more here
  - Kolinth plays a song about Acheron in his honour
- The party stake out the pub, but Harvey's contact does not emerge
- Tiresias follows him back towards Gellin's manor and attempts to read his mind
  - Gets seen
  - Casts sleep
  - Runs away
  - No upside
# The Council Meeting
- Eda Owland is talking about how concerning the lizardman news is
- Anders Solomon goes off about how dangerous they are and that they need to be contained
  - He tells us he'll pay us 5sp per lizardman tail we bring him, and chaos erupts
  - Eda is exasperated and trying to maintain order
  - Eliander and Manistrad are also on that side, but not fully supported Eda
  - Gellin is trying to stay out of it and vaguely agreeing with Eda
- Tiresias gets some new clothes and a haircut in an attempt to change his looks a bit following the previous night
- Eda offers us 700gp to go through the marshes to the south, locate the lizardmen and find out what they want
- While we wait to see Eda before we go, and a messenger tells us [[Anders Solomon]] wants to see us, and a guard also tells us [[Eliander Fireborn]] wants to see us too!
## Meeting Anders
- Anders seems fairly well-off judging by his house. It's large and well furnished.
- He reiterates his offer still stands
- There's something else up, but we can't really tell what
## Meeting Eliander
- He tells us Anders only got on the council because his mother died
- Eliander tells us the weapons we found were manufactured in [[Ludenham]] - it's a mystery how it ended up on a sea prince ship
- He wants us to figure out where they came from - he can't overtly pay us, but he'll be in our debt
	- Someone would have needed serious shipping connections to move that much stuff...
- Eliander asks us to follow him and leads us to another room downstairs to a locked map room
	- Most of the maps here look like prototypes - it's staffed by a slight cartographer
	- He emphasises that we shouldn't tell anyone that this room exists - it would draw suspicion and worry if they found out the crown was creating detailed maps of the coastline
## Meeting Eda
- Eda's in [[The Snapping Line]], surrounded by locals
- She tells us we can meet the Brians in the morning and head through the swamp towards the lizardfolk
- It's about a 15 hour trek there, we can just about make it in a day
> *We rest*
- Agavea continues to have dreams featuring bestial fighting, and flashes of [[Aengus]]' eyes
# The Swamp
- We pass [[Bracksmore]], head down through some coastal lowlands, and enter the marshy bog beyond
- We pick up the charm trail without too much difficulty
- The marshes are dense and cold, and progress is slow
- Late in the day, a group of mollywogs comes out of the swamp and attacks us!
	- We defeat them and save both Brians from becoming frog food
	- The king shows up, but we scare him off and claim the pile of loot they had created nearby
- We make camp where the mollywogs had been keeping their loot
- Overnight, Agavea has another rage dream
	- She pins down the strange bestial thing once more - feeling fear and rage mixed like a cornered animal
	- She bonds with the bestial spirit and gains proficiency in animal handling
> *We rest*
- The next day, we make our way through the worst of the swamp and back onto more solid ground, arriving at the shores of the Dunwater river
- There's a large cave entrance, which we're pretty sure is the right place. But there's a snag - Kolinth sees something large in the water
# The Lizardman Caves
- The big thing turns out to be the a sea crocodile thing that the guards use as a mount
- We distract the guards away from the entrance with some lights, and sneak into the cavern
- The 
# The Throne Room
- There's a whole load of different creatures in here
	- Some Koalinth (aquatic hobgoblin)
	- Some sea-anenonme creatures
- The queen is attended by a senior shaman and several advisors
- Tiresias offers her the klein bottle from the manor as a gift
