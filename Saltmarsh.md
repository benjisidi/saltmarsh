# Saltmarsh
Saltmarsh occupies a strategic location along the Azure Sea, near the border with the wilderness of the Hool Marshes and other untamed lands. The town’s history is one of survival and adaptation; its people have weathered pirate raids from the [Sea Princes](https://saltmarsh.tiddlyhost.com/#Sea%20Princes), smuggling operations, and natural disasters over the years.

Its relatively isolated location has led to it having its own, relatively distinct culture within Keoland, primarily focused around the fishing industry.

# Keoland
Keoland is a proud and ancient realm in the world of Greyhawk. It was once an ambitious and expansionist kingdom, at war to the East, North and West. For over three centuries, it stood as one of the dominant powers in the region, pushing the boundaries of its influence to the edges of the Azure Sea and beyond.

However, this golden age of conquest eventually faded and more recently [King Kimbertos Skotti](https://saltmarsh.tiddlyhost.com/#King%20Kimbertos%20Skotti) has turned inward, focusing on maintaining his heartlands and converting the kingdom into a trade powerhouse.
