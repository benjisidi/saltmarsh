We get onto the ship and kill *everyone*. [[Agevea]] finds a pseudodragon who doesn't like anyone but her. We find some wine, some silvery lead ingots that turn out to be lizardman money. 25g in total.
## Lizardman's Room
- A pseudodragon that's now [[Agevea]]'s pet
## Mage's Room
- There's some carvings on the walls documenting his interactions with minor spirits
- A lockbox full of coins and gems (50gp)
- Spell scroll: Gust of Wind
- His spellbook
## Captain's Room
- Man was a PLAYER - he had three "wives" in three different ports, none of which knew each other
- A curious semi-literate document from lizardmen requesting additional shipments of ironware
- Two healing potions
- A key??
- Big pile of maps: mostly cartographer standard maps of the nearby coastlines, and one roughly drawn map that's hard to decipher
- More payment from the lizardfolk - 15gp
## Bosun's Quarters
- More lizardman currency - 10gp
- Effects of someone who clearly isn't the bosun
	- Finely wrought sword
	- Finely made, somewhat practical clothing - like a high quality scout's outfit
- Hidden door in the wall - the bosun's key fits!
	- There's a prisoner in there
	- He's a sea elf!
