# Gellin's Party
- [[Tiresias]] goes to ask [[Agevea]] if she's heard of [[Harvey Cutt]] or where he might be found, but she hasn't heard of him and doesn't know where Saltmarsh's illicit activity tends to take place
- [[Kolinth]] tells an absolute bomb of a story about rabbits and impresses exactly one man named Courtney
- We follow catch Harvey's trail and manage to follow him into town
- Seems like he's heading to the [[Speakeasy]] run by [[Curtly]]
	- We follow him there, and he heads upstairs to have a conversation with someone unknown - we don't manage to divine much more here
	- Kolinth plays a song about Acheron in his honour
- The party stake out the pub, but Harvey's contact does not emerge
- Tiresias follows him back towards Gellin's manor and attempts to read his mind
	- Gets seen
	- Casts sleep
	- Runs away
	- No upside
# The Council Meeting
