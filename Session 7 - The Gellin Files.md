# Gellin's Party
- [[Tiresias]] goes to ask [[Agevea]] if she's heard of [[Harvey Cutt]] or where he might be found, but she hasn't heard of him and doesn't know where Saltmarsh's illicit activity tends to take place
- [[Kolinth]] tells an absolute bomb of a story about rabbits and impresses exactly one man named Courtney
- We follow catch Harvey's trail and manage to follow him into town
- Seems like he's heading to the [[Speakeasy]] run by [[Curtly]]
  - We follow him there, and he heads upstairs to have a conversation with someone unknown - we don't manage to divine much more here
  - Kolinth plays a song about Acheron in his honour
- The party stake out the pub, but Harvey's contact does not emerge
- Tiresias follows him back towards Gellin's manor and attempts to read his mind
  - Gets seen
  - Casts sleep
  - Runs away
  - No upside
# The Council Meeting
- Eda Owland is talking about how concerning the lizardman news is
- Anders Solomon goes off about how dangerous they are and that they need to be contained
  - He tells us he'll pay us 5sp per lizardman tail we bring him, and chaos erupts
  - Eda is exasperated and trying to maintain order
  - Eliander and Manistrad are also on that side, but not fully supported Eda
  - Gellin is trying to stay out of it and vaguely agreeing with Eda
- Tiresias gets some new clothes and a haircut in an attempt to change his looks a bit following the previous night
- Eda offers us 700gp to go through the marshes to the south, locate the lizardmen and find out what they want
- While we wait to see Eda before we go, and a messenger tells us [[Anders Solomon]] wants to see us, and a guard also tells us [[Eliander Fireborn]] wants to see us too!
## Meeting Anders
- Anders seems fairly well-off judging by his house. It's large and well furnished.
- He reiterates his offer still stands
- There's something else up, but we can't really tell what
## Meeting Eliander
- He tells us Anders only got on the council because his mother died
- Eliander tells us the weapons we found were manufactured in [[Ludenham]] - it's a mystery how it ended up on a sea prince ship
