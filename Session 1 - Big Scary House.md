# [[The Snapping Line]]
We spot [[Eda Owland]] in the pub and decide to see what she knows about [[Bracksmore]]. She says there have been other reports of screams and eerie lights coming from the house, but doesn't have any more concrete information, other than the fact that an adventurer went missing there a few weeks ago. She also mentions that things with the [[Lizardfolk]] are ratcheting up (more recruitment into the town guard, increased Lizardfolk sightings near the town, etc).

[[Kolinth]] asks Eda to tell him about her tattoos when he returns. He spends the evening telling stories in the pub, making friends with the sailors.

> Question: Is a shack worse or better than a hovel?

*We rest*

[[Agevea]] finally tells us her name, and [[Kolinth]] makes some very herby eggs.
# [[Primewater Mansion]]
The house is a hive of activity - there's lots of people bringing alcohol and food both into the house and courtyard, all being coordinated by a halfling chef. [[Gellin Primewater]] is having a feast this evening, which is open to everyone.

[[Kolinth]] gives the chef, [[Felica]] some herbs and spices to dress the roast pig with.

A look of consternation passes over him when we mention [[Bracksmore]]. He says normally, the elves of the [[Dreadwood]] normally prevent things from [[The Spirit]] reaching [[Saltmarsh]].

Apparently, the alchemist had been buying a lot of gems, and had created some sort of stone for turning things into gold.

## Scouting ahead
We head South out of Saltmarsh and along the coast. It's a grim, drizzly, late-autumn day and a small crowd accompany us part of the way, until we crest a hill and see the house perched on an outcropping on a cliff above us. It seems to cast a gloom around it, and the crowd quickly disperses.

Inspecting it through a spyglass, it appears to be in quite the state of disrepair. Meanwhile, [[Kolinth]] summons his owl [[Aurora]] and wargs into her to look through the collapsed roof.

Aurora sees there's something insectoid nesting in the roof of the house. She decides to fly in, and six [[Sturge]]s (giant, monstrous mosquitos about the size of a cat) burst from their hiding places. She narrowly escapes, flying between them and out of the roof.
## Entering the House
We carefully make our way through the garden, once beautiful but now overgrown. We head over to a well, and see something sparking at the bottom. [[Agevea]] starts to scramble down the well, and as she does two large snakes emerge, one below and one above, ambush us! With difficulty, we kill them and retrieve some coins from the bottom of the well.

We decide to enter the house to find somewhere safe to rest. Aurora does some scouting and finds the interior as dilapidated as the exterior. She enters a kitchen and rolls a ''double natural one'' on a perception check... [[Agevea]] follows her into the kitchen and detects something skittering beneath the floorboards.

We all run back outside and start resting when some giant weasels decide we look like snacks. Shit. Luckily, [[Kolinth]] BBQs the lead weasel and the others eat it and leave us alone.

The rattling in the kitchen turns out to be a mouse, and despite finding tracks leading further into the building, we decide to investigate the stairs leading down beneath the kitchen first. We find a wine cellar, and there's a corpse that died of bludgeoning damage. There's one bottle of wine that has rolled under one of shelves, worth 50gp! We reckon the person who died has been here for some time. The body has long since been looted, but the armour is in ok shape.

[[Agevea]] notices a scuffmark near one of the walls, and as she goes to shove it open, we all hear an ethereal voice scream *WELCOME TO HELL!* - it's clearly a ruse, though, it doesn't sound like it's actually coming from the spirit. In the room behind the hidden door, there's three heavy-set sailors from the town who attack the party. We kill them, and find the room beyond has bunks and supplies in it, looking like the sailors have camped out here. There's 10 bunks in the room, all of which look like they've been slept in at some point. The dead have tattoos suggesting they were [[Sea Princes]].

We break into a small room that looks nicer than the main area - there's a plush bed, some books, lit candles suggesting it was recently occupied. We find a bullseye lantern, a long fancy cloak, flint and steel and some candles, and a piece of parchment with some kind of signalling pattern on it.

Books, 10gp each:
* A volume of erotic poetry
* A naval almanac, listing tide times for the area around Saltmarsh
* A treatise on [[Luz]], a beastial spirit.

The other room seems like someone (thing?) has tried to break out of it. It's barred from the outside with the door bulging outwards from some large impact. In red, on the door is labelled DANGER.
